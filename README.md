# SEEDLabs
Collection the SEED labs from my Network Security class

## Labs
### DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security)
[Lab Instructions](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Files/DNSSEC/DNSSEC.pdf) \
[Lab Report](Labs/thomas-DNSSEC-SEEDLab.pdf) \
A hands on and in depth apporach to how DNSSEC is used. Large emphasis on verifying the trust chain and how multiple domains interact with each other.
- I found out that for Task 4, I did not need to include the bind.keys in the named.conf file. I had the dnssec-validation to yes instead auto.
### PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)
[Lab Instructions](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Files/Crypto_PKI/Crypto_PKI.pdf) \
[Lab Report](Labs/thomas-PKI-SEEDLab.pdf) \
A lab focused on hands on application of public key encryption and how they interact with certificates.
### TLS (Transport Layer Security)
[Lab Instructions](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Files/Crypto_TLS/Crypto_TLS.pdf) \
[Lab Report](Labs/thomas-TLS-SEEDLab.pdf) \
Focus on the Transport Layer of security, with a tigher emphasis on how certificates are used to verify trust between devices.
